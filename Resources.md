### Clean code and the importance
Tips on writing clean code: https://www.investigatii.md/uploads/resurse/Clean_Code.pdf
 * Bad code is like being able to point out a bad painting, you get to know its bad only after seeeing examples of bad code.
 Good code characteristics (according to Bjarne stroustrup)
  1. elegant, efficient, straightforward logic (so that bugs can be avoided), 
  2. dependecies minimal to ease maintenance, 
  3. error handling, 
  4. performance close to optimal
  5. has unit test (high cohesion in one block) and acceptance test(Given-when-then for stakeholder sake)
  6. meaningful names for functions, classes, declaration.
  
### Design Patterns
* https://sophia.javeriana.edu.co/~cbustaca/docencia/DSBP-2018-01/recursos/Erich%20Gamma,%20Richard%20Helm,%20Ralph%20Johnson,%20John%20M.%20Vlissides-Design%20Patterns_%20Elements%20of%20Reusable%20Object-Oriented%20Software%20%20-Addison-Wesley%20Professional%20%281994%29.pdf
1. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again and describes the solution to the problem in a way that could be used
a million times without doing it same twice.
2. Popular and most used - Factory, Decorator, Singleton
3. Pattern has 4 elements
    * Pattern name (handle to describe a design problem)
    * Problem (when to apply the pattern)
    * Solution (elements that make up the design, relationships, responsibilties and collaboration)
    * consequences (reuslts and trade-offS)

4. MVC (model view controller)
   * model - underlying application data
   * view - different presentation of the same underlying data
   * controller - the way the user interacts with the user input.
